# Project description: 

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), I will train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). I will first make use of `pandas` and `seaborn` packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors to prepare for applying machine learning algorithms.

Next, I will use the `scikit-learn` package to predict whether you can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. I will go over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.
